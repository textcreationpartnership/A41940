            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Great Robbery in <hi>Hatton-Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>FOR ſome time (conſidering the ſeaſon of the year) the Town has been pretty free from Attempts of Burglary and Robbery, which may in great meaſure be aſcribed to the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Guards and diligent Watch kept in all places, thereby preventing them of any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities to put their miſchievous Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in practiſe; yet ſtill their intentions (no doubt) were as bad as ever, and a conſiderable Gang had it ſeems been Club<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing their Pates for ſome new Stratagems to carry on their Trade; (for ſo thoſe Vermine call Stealing and Robbing innocent and more induſtrious people) as appears by the following Attempt, of which the notable Circumſtances oblige us to give a true Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for publick ſatisfaction, though not
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:44214:3"/>in the leaſt intending to prejudge the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal before their lawful Tryal, nor fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal the Evidence as to particulars, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to relate matter of Fact in general, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus:</p>
            <p>On <hi>Sunday</hi> the <hi>29th</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> about Eight of the Clock in the Evening, ſeveral perſons Arm'd came to the Houſe of a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of conſiderable Fortune and Ovali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in <hi>Hatton-Garden,</hi> and knocking, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended they had an Order from Authority to ſearch the Houſe for dangerous perſons, making uſe of the publick Diſtempers of the Times to colour their wicked deſign, and had by ſome means obtained the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of ſome Circumſtances that at firſt rendred what they ſaid a little plauſible to belief: But being deſired to produce their Warrant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they in an Hectoring manner refuſed, only alledged themſelves to be Soldiers, and one took upon himſelf the quality of a Lieutenant, and commanded the reſt, ſetting Centinels at the door, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In ſhort, after ſome diſcourſe, they letting in more of their Crew, declared, That it was
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:44214:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>money they wanted, and money they muſt have, ſetting Piſtols to the peoples breaſts, and ſo locked up all or the greateſt part of the Family in a private Room (as they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed), and ſo fell to ranſack the Houſe.</p>
            <p>Taking away two large Silver Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks, one great Salt, two Caudle-cups, one Baſon and Ewer of Silver, two other Silver Cups, a Salver, one great Tankard, one Silver Plate, a Silver Sugar-diſh, a ſmall Salt, ſeveral parcels of Silver Spoons, two Cruſes (all which are ſince taken again); two Diamond Rings of very great value, and between fifteen and twenty pound in Money, with ſeveral other things here o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. And 'tis probable had ſtoln many more, but that by good luck ſome of the Family ſo ſhut up as aforeſaid, got out at a paſſage unknown to them, backwards, and crying out Thieves, ſtartled them ſo, as they thought fit to go off with what they had got, rather than hazard ſtaying for a further booty. Their flight was ſo manag'd, that none of them were taken, it being a pretty while before Neighbours could get
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44214:4"/>round, and gather together, and the people of the Houſe get out to purſue them.</p>
            <p>However Bills being loft at all probable places, as Goldſmiths, Brokers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and a reward propoſed for diſcovery; On <hi>Tueſday</hi> following a Woman came to a certain Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, asking him if he would buy a quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Plate; to which he ſeeming willing, ſhe told him the place, being the <hi>Horſe-ſhooe Tavern</hi> in <hi>Shooe-Lane,</hi> which it ſeems was the Thieves Rendezvouz; but the Broker having one of the before-mentioned Bills, and upon the Circumſtances ſuſpecting this might be the ſame Plate, like an honeſt man reſolves to apprehend them if he could; the better to effect this, he ſeemed very willing to accept of the bargain, and ſends in a full bag to the ſaid place, as money to pay for it, though in truth it was only a bag filled with farthings to amuſe them. In the mean time he acquaints the perſon rob'd, what was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to be ſold him, and where he was to meet them; who procuring a Juſtices War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, Lieutenant <hi>Salter</hi> a Conſtable living by <hi>Fleet-Bridge,</hi> went to ſeize them, who had
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44214:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>with him two Files of Muſquetiers, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of his own Watchmen that he ſent for to aſſiſt him on that occaſion. Having beſet the Houſe, and placed neceſſary Centinels abroad, they entred, there being at that time ſix of the Thieves there, each or whom had a Piſtol and a Sword; but guilt makes Cowards; they made ſome ſhew of reſiſtance, for they perceived themſelves diſcovered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Conſtable came at them, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured every one to ſhift for himſelf; one leaped out of a Window into a Court back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, where being ſtopt by a Centinel, he run him into the body, but 'tis hoped the wound may not prove mortal; and the Thief though he had done the miſchief, was taken, as was another that got out at the Balcony, and ſo on the Sign-poſt, and three more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the top of the Houſe; but one eſcaped, whether over the Houſes, or what other way is not known. Beſides the Five Men, the before-mentioned Woman that went to the Broker was taken, who acknowledges that on <hi>Monday</hi> night they ſent for her, and deſired her to wiſh them to a Cuſtomer,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44214:5"/>which ſhe did as aforeſaid, and that the ſame is all ſhe knows of the matter.</p>
            <p>The Plate before recited was found in the Cellar of the ſaid Tavern; the Five Men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing examined before a Juſtice, were Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to <hi>Newgate,</hi> and the Woman to the <hi>Counter.</hi>
